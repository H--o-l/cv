    \conc{Submission for software engineer position at Paris}
    \opening{Hi,\newline{}}
    
      I submit my candidature for software engineer position. 
      I work 3 years in embedded systems for automatic subways in Alstom company.
      
      I barely meet requirements for your position, I develop C programs and groovy scripts but never C++ or java outside school. 
      Moreover algorithms is not really a thing in embedded system, at least not in the usual way. Recursive calls, deep stacks and dinamyc allocations aren't allowed. 
      
      Nevertheless I participate in software design, software optimization and continious integration.  
      I also demonstrate that I am a quick learner.
      
      Finally I made some personnal projects. Never go to far but I build some knowledge in linux, python and home automation that way.\\\\
         
      I think I match the google phylosophy. I am not the smartest but I am driven by curiosity, and I am amazed by all things we can learn in this world.
      
      I like to try new techniques, work with others and learn from them. Use good ideas from outside and find how to make them work efficiently as developping my own solutions.
      
      But the most, I like that technics help humanity do better and improve people everyday life.\\\\
